                <h1 class="arial">Tutorial</h1>
                <p class="arial">The game is quite simple. First, what you need are the FUNNYCARDS you want to play with &#40;2 Entity Cards, 3 Item Cards&#41;. Then, get some dice and 2 stopwatches. Now you have the basic materials for playing. A player you choose starts off and the game has started!</p>
                <h2 class="arial">Attacking</h2>
                <p class="arial">Attacking is really easy to do. Just say which entity to attack, and then it will attack it. The attacked entity's health will decrease by the amount specified in the "attack dmg" section. When an entity's health reaches 0, it's now dead. Play your other entity &#40;provided you still have one&#41; to continue playing. If you have no more entities, it's over.</p>
                <h2 class="arial">Using Items</h2>
                <p class="arial">You may have noticed that you have 3 items in your hand, and want to play them. Here's what you need to do: <br> Take the item that you want to play, and put it in front of you so the other player can see it. Then, announce that you will play that card. Saying "I'll play [insert card name here]" or "I summon [insert card name here]" are all applicable, but anything that gets the message across is enough. After you've set down the card, read what the abilities of the card do, and them apply them to an active entity. For example, if my card said "+50 health", I'd give it an extra 50 health.</p>
                <h2 class="arial">Special abilities</h2>
                <p class="arial">Most Entities have special abilities. These special abilities can be played by saying something along the lines of "I summon the special ability '[insert special ability name here]'." These effects then get carried out to the game. For example, if the card said "-50 health on one of enemy's active entities", you would do what it said.</p>
